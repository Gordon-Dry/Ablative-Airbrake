# Ablative-Airbrake

Hi,

This Ablative-Airbrake mod adds a stockalike airbrake coated with ablator.

This part reuse the stock textures to save your RAM, those included are fake of 4x4 pixels.

It uses the "KSP Add-on Version Checker" mod if you have it installed (not included in this download) to check its version by using a connexion on my github page given below, read the "KSP Add-on Version Checker" page for more details.

-No Dependancy mods.

Installation:

-On update remove any existing older version.

-Copy/paste the folder Ablative-Airbrake in your "Kerbal Space Program\GameData" directory.

-Enjoy!
